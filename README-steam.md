[h2]Generate Farming Simulator 25 map from real world data[/h2]

You can find the latest release, documentation and examples on the [url=https://github.com/iwatkot/maps4fs]GitHub repository[/url].

[h3]Disclaimer[/h3]

[i]
The main goal of this project is to generate map templates, based on real-world data, for the Farming Simulator. It's important to mention that [b]templates are not maps[/b]. As a template you'll receive an empty map, where the terrain is shaped according to real-world data and textures are showing different types of terrain and objects (e.g. roads, fields, forests, buildings) with correct shapes and scales. So it's like a blueprint for a map. You don't need to bother with terrain shaping and object placement, you can start creating your map right away. If you thought that you could just run this tool and get a playable map, then I'm sorry to disappoint you. But if you are a map maker, then this tool will save you a lot of time.
