## Tips and Hints

Here you'll find some useful advice for a map creation process.

### Create a Ground Colision Map

At the end of the map creation process, you need to create a ground collision map. It's a very important step because it will define where the vehicles can drive and where they can't.  
To do it, in Giants Editor go to **Scripts** -> **Shared scripts** -> **Map** -> **Create Ground Collision Map**. If you don't do this, you'll face some issues in the game.  
➡️ Any time you edit the map, you need to do it again.
