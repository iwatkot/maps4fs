# Legacy & Outdated Documentation

This section contains documentation for features, methods, and approaches that are **no longer actively maintained or recommended** but are still available for reference.

## Why Keep Legacy Documentation?

While Maps4FS continues to evolve with automated features and improved workflows, some users may prefer manual approaches or need to reference older methods for specific use cases.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Deprecated deployment methods** that still work but aren't supported
- **Manual workflows** that have been automated but some users prefer to do manually
- **Old configuration approaches** that have been superseded by newer methods
- **Historical features** that may be useful for understanding the evolution of Maps4FS

## ⚠️ Important Notice

Documentation in this section:
- ❌ **Not actively maintained** - May become outdated over time
- ❌ **Limited support** - Community support only, no official assistance
- ❌ **No new features** - These methods won't receive updates or improvements
- ✅ **Still functional** - Should work as documented, but use at your own discretion

## Recommended Approach

For the best experience with latest features, security updates, and official support, always prefer the current documentation over legacy methods. Only use legacy approaches if you have specific requirements that aren't met by current methods.
