# Field System Architecture

## Overview: Cultivation Areas in Farming Simulator

Fields represent the **active cultivation areas** where players grow, manage, and harvest crops. While distinct from farmlands (which define ownership and economic zones), fields serve as the functional agricultural workspace that drives core gameplay mechanics.

**Critical Distinction**: 
- **Fields** = Cultivation areas where crops are grown and harvested
- **Farmlands** = Property ownership zones that may contain multiple fields and determine economic control

**Strategic Value**: Pre-configured fields provide immediate gameplay value, though players can create custom fields during gameplay if needed.

## Data Source & Geographic Foundation

### OpenStreetMap Integration

**Primary Data Source**: [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) agricultural land use tags  
**Key OSM Tags**: `landuse=farmland`, `landuse=meadow`, and related agricultural classifications

**Data Quality Impact**: Field generation quality directly correlates with OSM data completeness and accuracy in your target region. Incomplete or outdated OSM agricultural data will result in missing or incorrectly positioned fields.

**Recommended Practice**: Review and enhance OSM agricultural data for your region before generation. See our [Custom OSM guide](custom_osm.md) for detailed data improvement workflows.

## Automated Field Generation

### Maps4FS Field Creation Process

Maps4FS automatically analyzes OSM agricultural areas and generates corresponding field definitions in your map's `map.i3d` file. This includes:

- **Field Boundaries**: Precise polygon definitions matching real-world agricultural plots
- **Field Numbering**: Sequential identification system for economic tracking
- **Size Optimization**: Filtering to ensure fields meet minimum gameplay requirements
- **Geometric Validation**: Ensuring field shapes are suitable for agricultural equipment

### Generation Statistics

The [generation info file](generation_info.md) provides detailed field creation metrics:
```json
"Fields": {
    "added_fields": 56,
    "skipped_fields": 5,
    "skipped_field_ids": []
}
```

**Field Processing Results**:
- **Added Fields**: Successfully created and validated cultivation areas
- **Skipped Fields**: Areas rejected due to size, shape, or complexity constraints
- **Quality Assurance**: Only fields suitable for practical farming operations are included

## Giants Editor Implementation

### Field Activation Workflow

**Automated Setup**: Maps4FS creates all necessary field nodes in `map.i3d`, but requires manual activation in Giants Editor.

**Step-by-Step Process**:
1. **Open Map**: Load your generated map in Giants Editor
2. **Access Field Toolkit**: Navigate to **Scripts** → **Shared Scripts** → **Map** → **Farmland Fields** → **Field Toolkit**
3. **Activate All Fields**: Click **"Repaint All Fields"** button
4. **Verify Results**: Confirm all fields appear correctly on the map surface

### Handling Complex Geometries

**Multipolygon Limitation**: OSM multipolygon field definitions may not import correctly due to geometric complexity.

**Manual Field Creation for Complex Areas**:
1. **Identify Missing Fields**: Compare OSM data with generated results
2. **Create New Field**: Click **"Create Field"** in the Field Toolkit
3. **Position Field Center**: New field appears at center of fields TransformGroup
4. **Define Boundaries**: Place PolygonPoints to match desired field shape
5. **Activate Field**: Click **"Repaint Selected Field"** to finalize

## Field Configuration Best Practices

### Optimal Field Design

**Size Guidelines**:
- **Minimum Size**: 0.5 hectares for equipment maneuverability
- **Optimal Range**: 2-10 hectares for balanced gameplay
- **Maximum Practical**: 50+ hectares for large-scale operations

**Shape Considerations**:
- **Equipment Access**: Ensure field shapes accommodate turning radii
- **Efficiency**: Rectangular or oval shapes optimize harvesting patterns
- **Realism**: Match real-world agricultural plot configurations when possible

### Performance Optimization

**Field Count Balance**:
- **Gameplay Value**: More fields provide diverse farming opportunities
- **Performance Impact**: Excessive field counts can affect simulation performance
- **Strategic Distribution**: Spread fields across map areas for balanced gameplay

**Technical Limits**:
- **Recommended Maximum**: 100-150 fields per 4×4km map
- **Processing Efficiency**: Consider CPU impact during crop growth cycles
- **Memory Usage**: Large field counts increase save file size

## Advanced Field Management

### Economic Integration

**Field-Farmland Relationship**: Fields exist within farmland boundaries and inherit ownership properties from their parent farmland zones.

**Economic Mechanics**:
- **Purchase Requirements**: Players must own the farmland before accessing contained fields
- **Rental Options**: Fields can be leased without farmland ownership in some scenarios
- **Property Value**: Field quality and size directly impact farmland valuation

### Customization Strategies

**Post-Generation Modifications**:
- **Field Subdivision**: Split large generated fields into smaller cultivation areas
- **Boundary Adjustment**: Fine-tune field edges for optimal equipment operation
- **Specialized Areas**: Create dedicated fields for specific crop types or farming methods

**Professional Workflow**:
1. **Generate Base Fields**: Use Maps4FS automated generation as foundation
2. **Analyze Gameplay Flow**: Test field accessibility and farming patterns
3. **Optimize Boundaries**: Adjust fields based on equipment requirements and player convenience
4. **Validate Economics**: Ensure field distribution supports balanced economic progression

**Strategic Outcome**: Well-designed field systems enhance gameplay by providing logical, efficient, and economically balanced agricultural opportunities that reflect real-world farming practices while optimizing for game mechanics.
