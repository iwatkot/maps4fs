# üóÇÔ∏è My Maps feature

My Maps feature helps to keep track of the the maps you generated with maps4fs, see the generation settings and easily reproduce the maps, if needed.

## How to start

While you don't need to do anything special to use the My Maps as it is automatically populated with the maps you generated, it's highly recommended to mount a directory on your machine, so all of the maps and cache will be stored there, not inside of the Docker container.  
This will allow you to keep all your maps whenever you're restarting the container or updating the image.  

```bash
docker run -d -p 8501:8501 -p 8000:8000 --name maps4fs -v /c/maps4fs:/usr/src/app/mfsrootdir iwatkot/maps4fs
```

‚ö†Ô∏è If you do not mount a valid directory, all your maps and cache will be lost when the container is stopped or removed (e.g., if you decide to upgrade maps4fs).  
<br>

The command above will mount the `C:/maps4fs` directory and all the maps will appear there, even if you deploy a new version of the maps4fs (and mount the same directory again).  
Of course, you can specify a different directory on your host machine if you prefer.  
<br>
‚ÑπÔ∏è Please note, that paths in Windows style WILL NOT WORK, you must use the Unix style paths instead, for example:  
- If you want to use `D:\maps4fs`, you must specify it as `/d/maps4fs`.
- If you want to use `C:\Users\username\games\maps4fs`, you must specify it as `/c/Users/username/games/maps4fs`.

## Working with maps
All your maps will appear automatically in the My Maps section. There you can find all the important information about the map, such as:  
- Game
- Version of the maps4fs
- Status (Complete, Incomplete, Error, API*)
- List of the assets inside (Background, Water, and so on)
- Basic information (coordinates, size and so on)


_* It's not recommended to use the maps that were generated by API requests, since they may contain only part of the data that was requested by the API call._

### Renaming a map
To better organize your maps, you can rename it. Simply click on the Input field and enter a new name.

## Search and filtering
You can use the search feature, to find the maps you are looking for. It's recommended to [rename](#renaming-a-map) your maps with descriptive names to make them easier to find.  
It's also possible to use filters, to find the maps by their statuses. By default, only the "Complete" maps are shown, but you can change the filter to see all maps.

## Actions with maps
The My Maps feature allows the following actions:
- Download
- Repeat
- Delete

### Downloading a map
To download a map, click on the "Prepare download" button next to the map you want to download. It will trigger packing map into an archive (if it's not already packed) and then the "Download" button will appear. Click on it to download the map.  
‚ÑπÔ∏è Note, that if the archive was created earlier, and then you've made some changes in the directory, they will not be reflected in the downloaded archive. If needed, you can remove the archive (or all of them) and re-trigger the download process.

### Repeating a map
This feature can be useful if you want to reproduce the same map with the same settings, or slightly adjust them. To repeat a map generation, click on the "Repeat" button next to the map you want to regenerate and then refresh the page. All the settings from the previous generation will be set (including Custom OSM file) and you can generate the map again, or adjust some settings if needed.

### Deleting a map
To delete a map, click on the "Delete" button next to the map you want to remove. This action cannot be undone, so make sure you really want to delete the map before confirming.
