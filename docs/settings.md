# Settings

The Settings feature provides centralized management of game-specific configurations that define how Maps4FS generates your maps. This powerful tool allows you to customize and organize your texture schemas, tree schemas, and map templates across different Farming Simulator versions.

ℹ️ **Availability**: Settings management is available in the Windows App and Docker deployment, similar to the [Presets](presets.md) feature.

## What are Settings?

Settings in Maps4FS refer to the configuration files that control various aspects of map generation:

- **[Texture Schemas](texture_schema.md)** - Define how OpenStreetMap data translates to Farming Simulator textures
- **[Tree Schemas](tree_schema.md)** - Control which tree species are available for procedural placement
- **Building Settings** - Control procedural building generation and placement
- **Map Templates** - Provide the foundational structure for generated maps
- **General Settings** - Software-wide configurations and server management

## How Settings Work

### 🎯 **Game Version Support**
Settings are organized by Farming Simulator version with different capabilities:

**Farming Simulator 25:**
- ✅ Texture Schemas
- ✅ Tree Schemas
- ✅ Building Settings
- ✅ Map Templates

- ✅ Texture Schemas
- ✅ Map Templates
- ❌ Tree Schemas *(not supported)*
- ❌ Building Settings *(not supported)*

### 📁 **Directory Structure**
Settings are stored in the `templates/` folder within your [Data Directory](data_directory.md):

```
📂 templates/
├── 📂 fs25/                    # Farming Simulator 25 settings
│   ├── 📂 texture_schemas/     # FS25 texture configurations
│   │   ├── 📄 default.json     # Default texture schema
│   │   ├── 📄 realistic.json   # Custom realistic textures
│   │   └── 📄 simplified.json  # Simplified texture set
│   ├── 📂 tree_schemas/        # FS25 tree configurations
│   │   ├── 📄 default.json     # Default tree selection
│   │   ├── 📄 european.json    # European tree species
│   │   └── 📄 minimal.json     # Minimal tree variety
│   └── 📂 map_templates/       # FS25 map templates
│       ├── 📄 standard.zip     # Standard FS25 template
│       └── 📄 custom.zip       # Custom map template
    │   ├── 📄 default.json     # Default texture schema
    │   └── 📄 custom.json      # Custom texture set
        └── 📄 modded.zip       # Modded map template
```

## Settings Management Interface

The Settings tab provides intuitive management similar to the [Presets](presets.md) system:

### 🗂️ **List View**
- **Visual Overview** - See all available settings organized by category
- **Quick Details** - File size, creation date, and modification date
- **Status Indicators** - Identify default settings and active configurations

### ⚙️ **Management Actions**
- **👁️ View** - Preview setting content without editing
- **✏️ Rename** - Give descriptive names to your configurations
- **🗑️ Delete** - Remove unwanted settings (with safety confirmations)
- **⭐ Set Default** - Mark settings as default for new map generations

### 🔄 **Integration with Generation**
- **Automatic Selection** - Default settings are applied automatically
- **Custom Override** - Choose specific settings for individual maps
- **Validation** - Ensures settings compatibility with selected game version

## Setting Types Explained

### 🎨 **Texture Schemas**
Control how OpenStreetMap features become Farming Simulator terrain textures.

**What they define:**
- Road surface types and widths
- Field and farmland appearances
- Forest and vegetation textures
- Water and shoreline materials
- Building and structure surfaces

**Use cases:**
- **Regional Authenticity** - European vs. American road styles
- **Visual Style** - Realistic vs. stylized appearances
- **Performance Optimization** - Simplified textures for better performance

**Learn more:** [Texture Schema Documentation](texture_schema.md)

### 🌳 **Tree Schemas** **
Define which tree species are available for procedural forest generation.

**What they control:**
- Available tree species (oak, pine, birch, etc.)
- Growth stage variations (young to ancient)
- Regional tree distributions
- Performance optimization through species selection

**Use cases:**
- **Geographic Realism** - Native species for specific regions
- **Seasonal Variation** - Appropriate tree types for climate zones
- **Performance Tuning** - Optimized tree selection for hardware capabilities

**Learn more:** [Tree Schema Documentation](tree_schema.md)

### 🗺️ **Map Templates**
Provide the foundational structure and assets for generated maps.

**What they include:**
- Basic map geometry and terrain structure
- Standard buildings and objects
- Game-specific configuration files
- Required texture and model assets

**Use cases:**
- **Game Compatibility** - Ensure maps work with specific FS versions
- **Custom Features** - Templates with specialized buildings or layouts
- **Mod Integration** - Templates designed for specific mod requirements

**Learn more:** [Map Templates Documentation](map_templates.md)

### 🏢 **Building Settings** **
Control how buildings are placed on your maps.

**Available Settings:**

#### 🏗️ **Generate Buildings**
- **Type:** Boolean (True/False)
- **Default:** `True`
- **Purpose:** Enable or disable building generation entirely

#### 🌍 **Region**
- **Type:** Selection (`auto`, `all`, `EU`, `US`)
- **Default:** `auto`
- **Purpose:** Define which regional building sets are available for placement
  - **`auto`** - Automatically selects appropriate region based on map coordinates
  - **`all`** - Ignores regional restrictions and allows mixing of all building types
  - **`EU`** - Uses only European-style buildings
  - **`US`** - Uses only American-style buildings

#### 📏 **Tolerance Factor**
- **Type:** Percentage (5% - 70%)
- **Default:** `30%`
- **Purpose:** Controls how precisely building sizes must match designated areas

**How Tolerance Factor Works:**
- **Lower values (5-15%)** - More precise size matching, fewer buildings placed, better visual accuracy
- **Medium values (20-40%)** - Balanced approach with good coverage and reasonable accuracy
- **Higher values (50-70%)** - More buildings placed, but with potentially significant size differences

⚠️ **Important:** Very low tolerance values may result in some building areas being left empty if no suitable matches are found.

**Use Cases:**
- **Realistic Placement** - Use lower tolerance for authentic building proportions
- **Dense Coverage** - Use higher tolerance to ensure most designated areas get buildings
- **Regional Theming** - Set specific regions for geographic authenticity
- **Mixed Styles** - Use "all" regions for diverse architectural variety

### 🗂️ **Data Directory Integration**
Settings are part of the [Data Directory](data_directory.md) structure:
- **Persistent Storage** - Settings survive container updates and restarts
- **File System Access** - Direct file manipulation when needed
- **Backup Inclusion** - Settings are included in data directory backups

### 🔗 **Schemas Editor Integration**
The [Schemas Editor](schemas_editor.md) directly integrates with Settings management:
- **Direct Save** - Save edited schemas directly to Settings from the editor
- **Visual Creation** - Create new configurations through visual interface and save to Settings
- **Template Creation** - Develop new configurations for Settings library
- **Seamless Workflow** - Edit schemas visually, then organize them in Settings

### 🗂️ **My Maps Integration**
The [My Maps](my_maps.md) feature provides schema access and Settings integration:
- **Schema Viewing** - View schemas from previously generated maps
- **Save to Settings** - Export schemas from successful maps directly to Settings
- **Configuration Discovery** - Find proven configurations from your map history
- **Best Practice Capture** - Save working schemas for future use

### 🔧 **General Settings**
Software-wide configurations and maintenance tools:

#### 🖥️ **Server Management**
Essential backend server operations and maintenance:
- **🧹 Clean Cache** - Remove cached data and temporary files to resolve issues with outdated data or free up disk space
- **🔄 Reload Templates** - Download and update default templates from the remote repository to ensure you have the most up-to-date schemas and configurations

#### 🌐 **Clear Browser Settings**
Reset all local preferences and defaults:
- **🗑️ Clear Settings** - Removes all stored preferences including default templates, presets, survey responses, and other settings saved in your browser's local storage

⚠️ **Important**: These operations affect the backend server and local data. Ensure no map generation is in progress before performing maintenance tasks.
