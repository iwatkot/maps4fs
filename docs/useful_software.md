## GRLE Convert

**🔗 [grleconvert on GitHub](https://github.com/Paint-a-Farm/grleconvert)**

A cross-platform command-line tool for converting GIANTS Engine density map files (GRLE and GDM) to and from PNG images. Essential for editing map layers outside of Giants Editor.

**What it does:**
- Convert GRLE/GDM files to PNG for editing in image editors
- Convert edited PNGs back to GRLE/GDM format (pixel-perfect, lossless)
- Auto-detect encoding parameters from map i3d files
- Generate pixel value guides that explain what each value means in your map layers

**Why it's useful:**
Working with infoLayer files (farmlands, fields, soil maps) and densityMap files (height, ground, foliage) is much easier when you can edit them as PNG images in tools like Photoshop or GIMP, then convert them back to the game's native format.

**Platform:** Windows, macOS, Linux
