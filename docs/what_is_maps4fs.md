- 🛰️ **Downloading satellite images** for realistic textures
- 🌾 **Creating farmable fields** based on real agricultural areas
- 🌲 **Generating forests** with appropriate tree placement
- 🌊 **Building water systems** including rivers and lakes
- 📐 **Producing 3D terrain** with accurate elevation models

### Highly Customizable
Every aspect of generation can be fine-tuned:
- **Terrain settings** (elevation, water depth, foundations)
- **Vegetation options** (tree density, grass types, forest species)
- **Field parameters** (size, padding, farmland margins)
- **Visual quality** (texture resolution, satellite imagery)

## 🎮 Perfect For
