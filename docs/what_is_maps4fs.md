- 🌍 **Processing OpenStreetMap** data for roads, buildings, and land use
- 🛰️ **Downloading satellite images** for realistic textures
- 🌾 **Creating farmable fields** based on real agricultural areas
- 🌲 **Generating forests** with appropriate tree placement
- 🌊 **Building water systems** including rivers and lakes
- 🛣️ **Generating 3D road meshes** with realistic textures from OSM data
- 🏘️ **Placing buildings** automatically in appropriate areas
- 📐 **Producing 3D terrain** with accurate elevation models

## 🌟 Why Choose Maps4FS?

### Based on Real Data
Unlike fictional maps, Maps4FS uses actual geographic data to create authentic farming environments. Your virtual farm will mirror real agricultural areas with accurate terrain, realistic field layouts, and proper infrastructure.

### Time-Saving Automation
What traditionally takes weeks of manual work in Giants Editor can be accomplished in hours. Maps4FS handles the heavy lifting of terrain generation, field creation, and asset placement automatically.

### Highly Customizable
Every aspect of generation can be fine-tuned:
- **Terrain settings** (elevation, water depth, foundations)
- **Vegetation options** (tree density, grass types, forest species)
- **Field parameters** (size, padding, farmland margins)
- **Building placement** (types, categories, custom assets)
- **Visual quality** (texture resolution, satellite imagery)

## 🎮 Perfect For

- **Map Modders** looking to create realistic farming environments
- **Server Administrators** wanting unique, location-based maps
- **Players** who want to farm their hometown or favorite locations
- **Content Creators** needing diverse, high-quality maps
