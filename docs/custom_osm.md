## How to create a custom OSM file

If you don't want to bother yourself editing the public version of the OSM data, deal with the community and so on, you can easily create your own OSM file and do there whatever you want. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to do it.

1. Download the JOSM editor from the [official website](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/) or directly from the [Windows Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xpfcg1gv0wwgzx) with one click.

2. Create a new layer (Ctrl + N).

3. Add imagery to see the map (Ctrl + Shift + N). You can use any map provider you want, in this example I'm using Bing.

4. Download the OSM data: **File** -> **Download data** (Ctrl + Shift + Down).

5. Draw the area of your ROI (region of interest). You don't need precision here, just ensure that it's large enough to cover the area you want to work with.  
After selecting the area, click **Download**.  
If you see the error message "Download area too large", download it in parts.

6. Now you should see all the data from the selected area.

7. You need to remove all the relations, otherwise the file can not be read by the `osmnx` library. To do it, go to the **Relations** tab, select everything and delete it.

8. Pay attention to the fact, that removing relations may lead to some areas to disappear, which was not defined separately from another objects. You can't do anything with it; if you miss something, you'll need to add it manually.

9. You can start editing your map. You can add new objects, remove existing ones, change their properties, etc. And there will be no one to tell you that you're doing something wrong or reverse your changes.

10. Save the file: **File** -> **Save as** (Ctrl + Shift + S).  
Now, you can use this file in the generator.  
Friendly reminder: save your file in some safe place, so you won't lose your changes.
