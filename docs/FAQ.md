## 🗺️ Map Data & Objects

### Some objects don't appear on my map, why?

Maps4FS uses data from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), so if something exists in real life but isn't in OSM's database, it won't appear on your map. Here's how to troubleshoot:

1. **Check if the object exists on OSM** - Visit OpenStreetMap and search your area
2. **If it's on OSM but missing from your map** - See the next question about whitelisted objects
3. **If it's not on OSM** - See the question about adding missing objects

### I can see the object on OSM, but it doesn't appear on my map, why?

Maps4FS uses a curated whitelist of supported objects rather than importing everything from OSM. You can check which objects are supported in our [Texture Schema](texture_schema.md) documentation.

**Need a new object type added?** Contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Sj5QKKyE42) or open a GitHub issue. We'll review and add appropriate objects to the whitelist.

### There's no needed objects on OSM, what should I do?

You have two main options:

#### Option 1: Add to OpenStreetMap (Recommended for permanent additions)
You can contribute to OSM by adding missing objects yourself:
1. Visit [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and create an account
2. Add objects with correct tags following [OSM Wiki guidelines](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page)
3. Changes typically appear in Maps4FS within 5-30 minutes
4. **Important**: Only add real-world objects and follow [OSM Guidelines](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Good_practice)

#### Option 2: Use Custom OSM (Recommended for testing/personal use)
For complete control over your map data, use our [Custom OSM](custom_osm.md) approach:
- Create and edit your own OSM data
- Perfect for testing, iterations, or personal modifications
- No community approval needed
- Full creative control over your map content

## 🎮 Giants Editor Issues

### Purple terrain glitches in Giants Editor

**Issue**: Terrain appears purple at certain viewing angles.

**Solution**: Select the **terrain** object, open the **Terrain** tab in **Attributes**, scroll to the bottom and click **Reload material**.

### Black screen flickering in Giants Editor

**Issue**: Screen keeps flickering black during editing.

**Solution**: 
1. Go to **Scripts** → **Create new script**
2. Name your script and paste this code:

```lua
setAudioCullingWorldProperties(-8192, -100, -8192, 8192, 500, 8192, 16, 0, 9000)
setLightCullingWorldProperties(-8192, -100, -8192, 8192, 500, 8192, 16, 0, 9000)
setShapeCullingWorldProperties(-8192, -100, -8192, 8192, 500, 8192, 16, 0, 9000)
```

3. Check **Always loaded** and execute the script

## 🚜 Game Loading & Installation

### Map loading hangs after installation

**Issue**: Placed the archive in mods directory but map won't load.

**Critical Steps**:
1. **Unpack the downloaded archive**
2. **Open in Giants Editor**
3. **Save the map**
4. **Repack as a new mod**

**Archive Naming**: Use simple names like `FS25_MyMap.zip`. Avoid special characters, spaces, or non-ASCII symbols.

### Crops destruction doesn't work / terrain glitches in-game

**Issue**: Gameplay problems with terrain interaction.

**Required Fix**: Create a ground collision map:
1. In Giants Editor: **Scripts** → **Shared scripts** → **Map** → **Create Ground Collision Map**
2. **Important**: Repeat this process every time you edit the map

## 🔧 Object Placement Issues

### Objects floating above terrain

**Issue**: Trees or other objects appear to hover above the ground.

**Solution**:
1. Select objects in **Scenegraph** (select each individual object, NOT groups)
2. **Pro tip**: Select first object, scroll to last, hold **Shift** and click last object
3. **Scripts** → **Shared scripts** → **Map** → **Terrain** → **Place objects on terrain**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Crashes

### Giants Editor crashes when opening map

**Troubleshooting Steps**:

1. **Check Console tab** for error messages if Editor loads partially
2. **If crashes on startup**, find the log file:
   ```
   C:/Users/<username>/AppData/Local/GIANTS Editor 64bit 10.0.3/editor_log.txt
   ```
   *Note: Folder name varies by Giants Editor version*

3. **Review latest log entries** for error patterns
4. **Need help?** Share relevant log sections in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Sj5QKKyE42)

### Game crashes or hangs when loading map

#### Enable Debug Mode
1. **Locate game.xml**:
   ```
   C:/Users/<username>/OneDrive/Documents/My Games/FarmingSimulator2025/game.xml
   ```
   *Note: OneDrive path may vary by system*

2. **Modify development section**:
   ```xml
   <development>
       <controls>true</controls>  <!-- Change false to true -->
       <openDevConsole onWarnings="false" onErrors="false"/>
   </development>
   ```

3. **In-game**: Press **~** to open console and check for errors

#### Check Game Logs
If game crashes before console access:
```
C:/Users/<username>/OneDrive/Documents/My Games/FarmingSimulator2025/log.txt
```

Focus on the latest entries and share relevant sections in [Discord](https://discord.gg/Sj5QKKyE42) if needed.

## 📦 Mod Installation Issues

### Game can't see the map mod

**Common Issues & Solutions**:

#### ✅ Correct Archive Naming
```
FS25_Titelski_breg.zip           ← Correct
FS25_mod name _ kgjdfg.zip       ← Incorrect (spaces/special chars)
```

#### ✅ Proper Archive Structure
**Correct structure** (files at root level):
```
📦FS25_Titelski_breg.zip
 ┣ 📂 map
 ┃ ┣ 📂 config
 ┃ ┃ ┣ 📄 aiSystem.xml
 ┃ ┃ ┗ 📄 [other XML files]
 ┃ ┣ 📂 data
 ┃ ┃ ┣ 📄 dem.png
 ┃ ┃ ┗ 📄 [weight & info files]
 ┃ ┣ 📄 map.i3d
 ┃ ┣ 📄 map.xml
 ┃ ┗ 📄 overview.dds
 ┣ 📄 icon.dds
 ┣ 📄 modDesc.xml
 ┗ 📄 preview.dds
```

**❌ Incorrect structure** (extra folder level):
```
📦FS25_Titelski_breg.zip
 ┗ 📂 extra_folder          ← This breaks everything!
   ┣ 📂 map
   ┣ 📄 icon.dds
   ┗ 📄 modDesc.xml
```
