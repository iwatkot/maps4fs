# Optimizing Your Maps4FS Workflow

Maps4FS revolutionizes map creation by automating tedious, time-consuming tasks so you can focus on what truly matters: creating engaging, high-quality content. The key to maximizing efficiency lies in understanding the distinction between **automated assets** and **custom assets**.

**Automated Assets**: Elements generated automatically by Maps4FS (terrain, roads, fields, basic structures) that require zero manual effort to create.

**Custom Assets**: Hand-crafted elements that add unique value and character to your map, requiring significant time investment.

**Golden Rule**: Never invest time in manual work until you're completely satisfied with the automated generation results. This simple principle can save you dozens of hours of wasted effort.

## Essential Preparation

### Optimizing OpenStreetMap Data

Your map's quality is fundamentally limited by the underlying OpenStreetMap (OSM) data quality. If your target region has incomplete or inaccurate OSM data, address this **before** beginning generation.

**Critical Recommendation**: Use the [custom OSM approach](custom_osm.md) rather than relying on public OSM data. This gives you complete control over your data without navigating OSM's community guidelines and approval processes. You can iterate freely, make region-specific adjustments, and maintain consistency across multiple generation cycles.

### Preserving Generation Parameters

Expect to generate your map multiple times before achieving optimal results. To ensure consistency and avoid configuration drift:

**Always save your `generation_info.json` file** after each satisfactory generation. This file contains all parameters needed to reproduce identical results, enabling you to:
- Maintain exact positioning, size, and rotation across iterations
- Preserve compatibility with existing custom assets when regenerating specific components
- Quickly revert to previous successful configurations

ðŸ†• **Presets Integration**: The [Presets](presets.md) system (Local Deployment only) dramatically improves workflow efficiency by allowing you to save and manage multiple configurations. Build libraries of successful settings, OSM data, and DEM files for instant reuse across projects.

Learn more in the [Generation Info documentation](generation_info.md).

## Phase 1: Automated Asset Validation

Once your OSM data meets your standards, begin the iterative generation process. This phase focuses exclusively on automated elementsâ€”resist any temptation to manually adjust content.

**Recommended Workflow:**

1. **Generate** â†’ Load the map in Giants Editor
2. **Evaluate** â†’ Assess automated elements: roads, fields, farmlands, terrain topology
3. **Resist Manual Edits** â†’ No matter how minor the issue appears, avoid manual fixes
4. **Iterate Ruthlessly** â†’ If results are unsatisfactory, delete everything except `generation_info.json` and regenerate
5. **Repeat** â†’ Continue until automated assets meet your quality standards

**Why This Matters**: Every minute spent manually adjusting automated assets is wasted effort. These elements will be overwritten in your next generation cycle, destroying your manual work.

## Phase 2: Custom Asset Development

**Only proceed to this phase when automated assets are production-ready.** Your time investment begins here.

**Pre-Development Checklist:**
- âœ… Automated terrain topology is acceptable
- âœ… Road networks are properly positioned and connected
- âœ… Field boundaries and farmland divisions are logical
- âœ… Background terrain and water meshes render correctly *(FS25: Auto-generated i3d files ready to import!)*
- âœ… Satellite imagery alignment is accurate
- âœ… Everything seems to be in its place

**Final Validation**: Before investing significant time in custom assets, perform one last comprehensive review of all automated elements. If you discover issues now, return to Phase 1â€”it's still cost-free to regenerate.

**Time Investment Begins**: Once you're confident in the automated foundation, you can begin creating custom buildings, decorative elements, unique landmarks, and other hand-crafted content that will differentiate your map.

Remember: Custom assets built on a solid automated foundation retain their value across minor regenerations, maximizing your return on time investment.
