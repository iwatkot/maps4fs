# Schemas Editor

The Schemas Editor is a powerful visual tool that allows you to edit and customize texture and tree schemas without manually editing JSON files. This intuitive interface makes it easy to modify how OpenStreetMap features are translated into Farming Simulator textures.

## üé® Textures Schema Editor

The Textures Schema Editor provides a visual interface for editing the [texture schema](texture_schema.md) - the foundational blueprint that transforms OpenStreetMap data into detailed Farming Simulator terrain.

*The Textures Schema Editor transforms the complex task of schema customization into an intuitive, visual experience. Whether you're a beginner looking to make simple adjustments or an advanced user creating completely custom configurations, this tool makes schema editing accessible to everyone.*

## üå≥ Tree Schema Editor

The Tree Schema Editor provides a visual interface for editing the [tree schema](tree_schema.md) - the configuration that defines which tree species are available for procedural placement on your generated maps.

### What is the Tree Schema Editor?

Instead of manually editing JSON tree definitions, the Tree Schema Editor offers:

- **Visual tree gallery** - Browse all available tree species with 3D previews
- **Growth stage management** - See and select different maturity levels for each species
- **Species filtering** - Organize trees by type (broadleaved, coniferous, fruit trees, etc.)
- **Selection management** - Easy bulk selection and deselection of tree varieties
- **Real-time validation** - Immediate feedback on schema configuration

### Key Features

#### üå≤ Visual Tree Gallery
- Browse all tree species with detailed 3D model previews
- View different growth stages (stage01 through stage05)
- Search and filter trees by species name or characteristics
- See reference IDs and leaf types at a glance

#### üéõÔ∏è Interactive Selection
- **Bulk Operations**: Select All / Deselect All for quick management
- **Species Grouping**: Trees organized by species with collapsible sections
- **Stage Selection**: Choose specific growth stages for natural variety
- **Type Filtering**: Filter by broadleaved, coniferous, or fruit trees

#### üìä Schema Management
- **Import/Export**: Load and save custom tree schema configurations
- **Template Integration**: Ensure selected trees are available in your map template
