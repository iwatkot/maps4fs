## Overview

The core idea is coming from the awesome [maps4cim](https://github.com/klamann/maps4cim) project.<br>

The main goal of this project is to generate map templates, based on real-world data, for the Farming Simulator. It's important to mention that **templates are not maps**. They are just a starting point for creating a map. This tool just uses built-in textures to highlight different types of terrain and buildings with correct shapes and scales and to generate a height map. The rest of the work is up to you. So if you thought that you could just run this tool and get a playable map, then I'm sorry to disappoint you. But if you are a map maker, then this tool will save you a lot of time.<br>
So, if you're new to map making, here's a quick overview of the process:

1. Generate a map template using this tool.
2. Download the Giants Editor.
3. Open the map template in the Giants Editor.
4. Now you can start creating your map (adding roads, fields, buildings, etc.).

## Resources

In this section, you'll find a list of the resources that you need to create a map for the Farming Simulator.<br>
To create a basic map, you only need the Giants Editor. But if you want to create a background terrain - the world around the map, so it won't look like it's floating in the void - you also need Blender and the Blender Exporter Plugins. To create realistic textures for the background terrain, the QGIS is required to obtain high-resolution satellite images.<br>

1. [Giants Editor](https://gdn.giants-software.com/downloads.php) - the official tool for creating maps for the Farming Simulator.
2. [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) - the open-source 3D modeling software that you can use to create models for the Farming Simulator.
3. [Blender Exporter Plugins](https://gdn.giants-software.com/downloads.php) - the official plugins for exporting models from Blender to i3d format (the format used in the Farming Simulator).

## Bugs and feature requests

➡️ Please, before creating an issue or asking some questions, check the [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md) section and the follow the [docs/get_help.md](Get Help) instructions.

## Special thanks

Of course, first of all, thanks to the direct [contributors](https://github.com/iwatkot/maps4fs/graphs/contributors) of the project.

But also, I want to thank the people who helped me with the project in some way, even if they didn't contribute directly. Here's the list of them:

- [H4rdB4se](https://github.com/H4rdB4se) - for investigating the issue with custom OSM files and finding a proper way to work with the files in JOSM.
- [kbrandwijk](https://github.com/kbrandwijk) - for providing [awesome tool](https://github.com/Paint-a-Farm/satmap_downloader) to download the satellite images from the Google Maps and giving a permission to modify it and create a Python Package.
- [Maaslandmods](https://github.com/Maaslandmods) - for the awesome idea to edit the tree schema in UI, images and code snippets on how to do it.
- [StrauntMaunt](https://gitlab.com/StrauntMaunt) - for developing procedural generation scripts, providing with the required updates for maps4fs and preparing the docs on how to use procedural generation.
