<p align="center"><i>Map example generated with maps4fs.</i></p>

## Overview

The core idea is coming from the awesome [maps4cim](https://github.com/klamann/maps4cim) project.<br>

The main goal of this project is to generate map templates, based on real-world data, for the Farming Simulator. It's important to mention that **templates are not maps**. They are just a starting point for creating a map. This tool just uses built-in textures to highlight different types of terrain and buildings with correct shapes and scales and to generate a height map. The rest of the work is up to you. So if you thought that you could just run this tool and get a playable map, then I'm sorry to disappoint you. But if you are a map maker, then this tool will save you a lot of time.<br>
So, if you're new to map making, here's a quick overview of the process:

1. Generate a map template using this tool.
2. Download the Giants Editor.
3. Open the map template in the Giants Editor.
4. Now you can start creating your map (adding roads, fields, buildings, etc.).

## Supported objects

The project is based on the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data. So, refer to [this page](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features) to understand the list below.

You can find the active schemas here:

- [FS25](/data/fs25-texture-schema.json)
- [FS22](/data/fs22-texture-schema.json)

Learn more how to work with the schema in the [Texture schema](#texture-schema) section. You can also use your own schema in the [Expert settings](#expert-settings) section.

## Generation info

The script will generate the `generation_info.json` file in the `output` folder. It is split into different sections, which represent the components of the map generator. You may need this information to use some other tools and services to obtain additional data for your map.<br>

List of components:

- `Config` - this component handles the `map.xml` file, where the basic description of the map is stored.
- `Texture` - this component describes the textures, that were used to generate the map.
- `DEM` - this component describes the Digital Elevation Model (the one which creates terrain on your map), which was used to generate the height map and related to the `dem.png` file.
- `I3d` - this component describes the i3d file, where some specific attributes properties, and paths to the files are stored.
- `Background` - this component describes the 8 tiles, that surround the map.

Below you'll find descriptions of the components and the fields that they contain.<br>
ℹ️ If there's no information about the component, it means that at the moment it does not store any data in the `generation_info.json` file.

### Config

Example of the `Config` component:

```json
"Config": {
    "Overview": {
        "epsg3857_string": "2249906.6679576184,2255734.9033189337,5663700.389039194,5669528.6247056825 [EPSG:3857]",
        "south": 45.304132173367165,
        "west": 45.267296012425376,
        "north": 20.263611405732693,
        "east": 20.211255476687537,
        "height": 4096,
        "width": 4096
    }
},
```

The `Overview` section contains information to create an overview image, which represents the in-game map. You can use the `epsg3857_string` to obtain the satellite images in the QGIS. So this section describes the region of the map plus the borders. Usually, it's exactly 2X the size of the map.<br>
And here's the list of the fields:

- `"epsg3857_string"` - the string representation of the bounding box in the EPSG:3857 projection, it is required to obtain the satellite images in the QGIS,<br>
- `"south"` - the southern border of overview region,<br>
- `"west"` - the western border of overview region,<br>
- `"north"` - the northern border of overview region,<br>
- `"east"` - the eastern border of overview region,<br>
- `"height"` - the height of the overview region in meters (2X the size of the map),<br>
- `"width"` - the width of the overview region in meters,<br>

### Texture

Example of the `Texture` component:

```json
"Texture": {
    "coordinates": [
        45.28571409289627,
        20.237433441210115
    ],
    "bbox": [
        45.29492313313172,
        45.27650505266082,
        20.250522423471406,
        20.224344458948824
    ],
    "map_height": 2048,
    "map_width": 2048,
    "minimum_x": 439161.2439774908,
    "minimum_y": 5013940.540089059,
    "maximum_x": 441233.5397821935,
    "maximum_y": 5016006.074349126,
},
```

And here's the list of the fields:

- `"coordinates"` - the coordinates of the map center which you entered,<br>
- `"bbox"` - the bounding box of the map in lat and lon,<br>
- `"map_height"` - the height of the map in meters (this one is from the user input, e.g. 2048 and so on),<br>
- `"map_width"` - the width of the map in meters (same as above),<br>
- `"minimum_x"` - the minimum x coordinate of the map (UTM projection),<br>
- `"minimum_y"` - the minimum y coordinate of the map (UTM projection),<br>
- `"maximum_x"` - the maximum x coordinate of the map (UTM projection),<br>
- `"maximum_y"` - the maximum y coordinate of the map (UTM projection),

### Background

The background component consists of the 8 tiles, each one representing the tile, that surrounds the map. The tiles are named as the cardinal points, e.g. "N", "NE", "E" and so on.<br>
Example of the `Background` component:

```json
"Background": {
"N": {
    "center_latitude": 45.30414170952092,
    "center_longitude": 20.237433441210115,
    "epsg3857_string": "2251363.25324853,2254278.318028022,5668072.719985372,5670987.784803056 [EPSG:3857]",
    "height": 2048,
    "width": 2048,
    "north": 45.31335074975637,
    "south": 45.29493266928547,
    "east": 20.250526677438195,
    "west": 20.224340204982035
},
}
```

And here's the list of the fields:

- `"center_latitude"` - the latitude of the center of the tile,<br>
- `"center_longitude"` - the longitude of the center of the tile,<br>
- `"epsg3857_string"` - the string representation of the bounding box in the EPSG:3857 projection, it is required to obtain the satellite images in the QGIS,<br>
- `"height"` - the height of the tile in meters,<br>
- `"width"` - the width of the tile in meters,<br>
- `"north"` - the northern border of the tile,<br>
- `"south"` - the southern border of the tile,<br>
- `"east"` - the eastern border of the tile,<br>
- `"west"` - the western border of the tile,<br>

## Texture schema

maps4fs uses a simple JSON file to define the texture schema. For each ofthe supported games, this file has unique entries, but the structure is the same. Here's an example of the schema for Farming Simulator 25:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "forestRockRoots",
    "count": 2,
    "exclude_weight": true
  },
  {
    "name": "grass",
    "count": 2,
    "tags": { "natural": "grassland" },
    "color": [34, 255, 34],
    "priority": 0
  },
  {
    "name": "grassClovers",
    "count": 2
  },
  {
    "name": "grassCut",
    "count": 2
  },
  {
    "name": "grassDirtPatchy",
    "count": 2,
    "tags": { "natural": ["wood", "tree_row"] },
    "width": 2,
    "color": [0, 252, 124]
  }
]
```

Let's have a closer look at the fields:

- `name` - the name of the texture. Just the way the file will be named.
- `count` - the number of textures of this type. For example, for the **dirtMedium** texture there will be two textures: **dirtMedium01_weight.png** and **dirtMedium02_weight.png**.
  ℹ️ There's one texture that has count `0`, it's the waterPuddle texture from FS22, which is not present in FS25.
- `tags` - the tags from the OpenStreetMap data. Refer to the section [Supported objects](#supported-objects) to see the list of supported tags. If there are no tags, the texture file will be generated empty and no objects will be placed on it.
- `width` - the width of the texture in meters. Some of the objects from OSM (roads, for example) are lines, not areas. So, to draw them correctly, the tool needs to know the width of the line.
- `color` - the color of the texture. It's used only in the preview images and has no effect on the map itself. But remember that previews are crucial for the map-making process, so it's better to set the color to something that represents the texture.
- `priority` - the priority of the texture for overlapping. Textures with higher priorities will be drawn over the textures with lower priorities.
  ℹ️ The texture with 0 priority considers the base layer, which means that all empty areas will be filled with this texture.
- `exclude_weight` - this is only used for the forestRockRoots texture from FS25. It just means that this texture has no `weight` postfix, that's all.
- `usage` - the usage of the texture. Mainly used to group different textures by the purpose. For example, the `grass`, `forest`, `drain`.
- `background` - set it to True for the textures, which should have impact on the Background Terrain, by default it's used to subtract the water depth from the DEM and background terrain.
- `info_layer` - if the layer is saving some data in JSON format, this section will describe it's name in the JSON file. Used to find the needed JSON data, for example for fields it will be `fields` and as a value - list of polygon coordinates.
- `invisible` - set it to True for the textures, which should not be drawn in the files, but only to save the data in the JSON file (related to the previous field).
- `procedural` - is a list of corresponding files, that will be used for a procedural generation. For example: `"procedural": ["PG_meadow", "PG_acres"]` - means that the texture will be used for two procedural generation files: `masks/PG_meadow.png` and `masks/PG_acres.png`. Note, that the one procuderal name can be applied to multiple textures, in this case they will be merged into one mask.
- `border` - this value defines the border between the texture and the edge of the map. It's used to prevent the texture from being drawn on the edge of the map. The value is in pixels.
- `precise_tags` - can be used for more specific tags, for example instead of `"natural": "wood"` you can use `"leaf_type": "broadleaved"` to draw only broadleaved trees.
- `precise_usage` - the same as `usage`, but being used with `precise_tags`.
- `area_type` - one of the supported by Giants Editor area types, such as: "open_land", "city", "village", "harbor", "industrial", "open_water". It will be reflected in the environment info layer file.  
- `area_water` - whenever this field is set to true, the area will be considered as water, and it will be changed in the environment info layer file.
- `indoor` - whenever this field is set to true, the area will be considered as indoor, and it will be reflected in the indoorMask info layer.
- `merge_into` - if specified, the layer with this parameter will be merged into the target layer and the content of the layer will be transferred to the target layer.

## Background terrain

The tool now supports the generation of the background terrain. If you don't know what it is, here's a brief explanation. The background terrain is the world around the map. It's important to create it because if you don't, the map will look like it's floating in the void. The background terrain is a simple plane that can (and should) be textured to look fine.<br>
So, the tool generates the background terrain in the form of the 8 tiles, which surround the map. The tiles are named as the cardinal points, e.g. "N", "NE", "E" and so on. All those tiles will be saved in the `background` directory with corresponding names: `N.obj`, `NE.obj`, `E.obj`, and so on.<br>
If you don't want to work with separate tiles, the tool also generates the `FULL.obj` file, which includes everything around the map and the map itself. It may be a convenient approach to work with one file, one texture, and then just cut the map from it.<br>

![Complete background terrain in Blender](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7266b8f1-bfa2-4c14-a740-1c84b1030a66)

➡️ _No matter which approach you choose, you still need to adjust the background terrain to connect it to the map without any gaps. But with a single file, it's much easier to do._

If you're willing to create a background terrain, you will need Blender, the Blender Exporter Plugins, and the QGIS. You'll find the download links in the [Resources](#resources) section.<br>

If you're afraid of this task, please don't be. It's really simple and I've prepared detailed step-by-step instructions for you, you'll find them [here](docs/006_backgroundterrain.md).<br>

## Overview image

The overview image is an image that is used as an in-game map. No matter what the size of the map, this file is always `4096x4096 pixels`, while the region of your map is `2048x2048 pixels` in the center of this file. The rest of the image is just here for a nice view, but you still may add satellite pictures to this region.<br>

<img width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ede9ea81-ef97-4914-9dbf-9761ef1eb7ca">

Cool image by [@ZenJakey](https://github.com/ZenJakey).

So, in the same way, you've downloaded the satellite images for the background terrain, you can download them for the overview image. Just use the `epsg3857_string` from the `generation_info.json` file. You'll find the needed string in the `Config` component in the `Overview` section:

```json
"Config": {
    "Overview": {
        "epsg3857_string": "2249906.6679576184,2255734.9033189337,5663700.389039194,5669528.6247056825 [EPSG:3857]",
    }
},
```

After that, you need to resize the image to 4096x4096 pixels and convert it to the `.dds` format.

## DDS conversion

The `.dds` format is the format used in the Farming Simulator for the textures, icons, overview, and preview images. There a plenty of options to convert the images to the `.dds` format, you can just google something like `png to dds`, and the first link probably will help you with it.<br>

List of the important DDS files:

- `icon.dds` - 256x256 pixels, the icon of the map,
- `preview.dds` - 2048x2048 pixels, the preview image of the map on the loading screen,
- `overview.dds` - 4096x4096 pixels, the overview image of the map (in-game map)

## Resources

In this section, you'll find a list of the resources that you need to create a map for the Farming Simulator.<br>
To create a basic map, you only need the Giants Editor. But if you want to create a background terrain - the world around the map, so it won't look like it's floating in the void - you also need Blender and the Blender Exporter Plugins. To create realistic textures for the background terrain, the QGIS is required to obtain high-resolution satellite images.<br>

1. [Giants Editor](https://gdn.giants-software.com/downloads.php) - the official tool for creating maps for the Farming Simulator.
2. [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) - the open-source 3D modeling software that you can use to create models for the Farming Simulator.
3. [Blender Exporter Plugins](https://gdn.giants-software.com/downloads.php) - the official plugins for exporting models from Blender to i3d format (the format used in the Farming Simulator).
4. [QGIS](https://qgis.org/download/) - the open-source GIS software that you can use to obtain high-resolution satellite images for your map.
5. [CompressPngCom](https://www.compresspng.com/) - the online tool to compress the PNG images. May be useful to reduce the size of the satellite images.
6. [AnyConv](https://anyconv.com/png-to-dds-converter/) - the online tool to convert the PNG images to the DDS format. You'll need this format for the textures, icons, overview, and preview images.
