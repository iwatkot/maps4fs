## Overview

The core idea originates from the excellent [maps4cim](https://github.com/klamann/maps4cim) project.<br>

The main goal of this project is to generate map templates based on real-world data for Farming Simulator. It's important to understand that **templates are not finished maps**. They serve as a foundation for map creation, using built-in textures to represent different terrain types and structures with accurate shapes and scales, along with generating realistic height maps. The detailed work of creating a complete, playable map remains with you. If you expected to simply run this tool and receive a ready-to-play map, this may not meet those expectations. However, if you're a map creator, this tool will significantly reduce your development time.<br>

For newcomers to map creation, here's the typical workflow:

1. Generate a map template using this tool.
2. Download the Giants Editor.
3. Open the generated template in Giants Editor.
4. Begin detailed map development (adding roads, fields, buildings, etc.).

## Resources

This section lists essential tools required for Farming Simulator map creation.<br>
For basic map development, you only need Giants Editor. However, creating background terrain‚Äîthe surrounding world that prevents your map from appearing to float in empty space‚Äîrequires additional tools: Blender with the official exporter plugins. For realistic background terrain textures, QGIS is needed to obtain high-resolution satellite imagery.<br>

1. [Giants Editor](https://gdn.giants-software.com/downloads.php) - Official map creation tool for Farming Simulator
2. [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) - Open-source 3D modeling software for creating Farming Simulator assets
3. [Blender Exporter Plugins](https://gdn.giants-software.com/downloads.php) - Official plugins for exporting models from Blender to i3d format (Farming Simulator's native format)
